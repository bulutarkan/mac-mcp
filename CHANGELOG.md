# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-06

- Added five MCP-native agent delegation tools: `agent_catalog`, `spawn_agent`, `list_agents`, `get_agent`, and `agent_action`.
- Added non-blocking OpenCode and Codex execution with provider/model/reasoning selection, working-directory and access controls, bounded timeouts, and persistent on-disk agent state.
- Added concise parent-agent handoffs so delegated work can use its own context without flooding the calling ChatGPT conversation with intermediate logs or reasoning.
- Added resumable provider sessions (`message`), retries, cancellation, despawn, compact listings, and opt-in debug logs.
- Added macOS-aware OpenCode/Codex binary discovery, including Homebrew and the ChatGPT-bundled Codex binary.
- Verified real OpenCode and Codex delegation, session follow-up, retry, three parallel agents, timeout handling, cancellation cleanup, and provider failure handling.
- Added unit coverage for final-result extraction and provider command construction.
- MCP tool count is now 64. The existing 59-operation REST/OpenAPI surface remains unchanged for backwards compatibility; agent delegation is currently MCP-only.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-03

- Fixed `ask_choice` so three choices fit macOS's three-button native dialog limit; two-choice dialogs retain a visible Cancel button and four-or-more choices are rejected clearly.
- Added native `ask_choice` and `ask_confirmation` human-in-the-loop tools with bounded, fail-closed dialog handling.
- Prevented concurrent native prompts from stacking by returning `prompt_busy` immediately when a dialog is already active.
- Hardened timeout cleanup for AppleScript, browser, shell, and interactive subprocesses so descendants do not remain stuck in the background.
- Exposed all 59 MCP tools as one-to-one Custom GPT Action operations with matching `operationId` names.
- Added REST aliases for file, macOS, browser, search, `mac_observe`, and `mac_act` tools.
- Kept the legacy grouped REST routes available for backwards compatibility while hiding them from the published OpenAPI schema.
- Updated the bundled OpenAPI schema to version 1.1.1 and verified 59 valid operations.
- Documented the OpenAPI/Custom GPT refresh flow and added the new release notes.
