# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-07

- Added the MCP-only `mac_mcp_update` tool for commit-based update checks and detached safe updates from `origin/main`; MCP tool count is now 70 while the existing REST/OpenAPI surface remains unchanged.
- Added `mac-mcp update --check` and `mac-mcp update` terminal commands using the same update engine.
- Added split repo/runtime update support: runtime customizations are preserved as a Git overlay and merged against the incoming commit before any real deployment changes are made.
- Updates block on dirty repositories or runtime merge conflicts, preserve untracked runtime data such as `.env`/agent state/logs, and create managed-file backups before syncing.
- Added automatic service restart and `/health` verification with runtime rollback on failed health checks; deployed commit state is tracked separately from repository HEAD for safe retries.
- Dependency refresh is conditional on `mcp_server/requirements.txt` changes.
- Verified a real temporary GitHub old-commit update (`26071a2` -> `4615ad2`) with three runtime customizations and `.env` preservation, plus dirty-repo and merge-conflict fail-safe tests.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-07

- Fixed `browser_find` ranking so exact text/role targets beat prefixes/substrings; role/text constraints are hard filters and short tokens no longer match inside unrelated words.
- Added consistent Turkish/Unicode normalization between Python ranking and in-page JavaScript matching.
- Made custom `select` actions wait for asynchronously injected dropdown options and settle after selection instead of failing immediately.
- Added `content` / `leaf` observation scopes that prune large ancestor wrappers and prioritize controls, headings, meaningful leaf text, cards, rows, and images.
- Made `browser_find` and `browser_act(return_state="full")` adaptively reduce dense payloads instead of surfacing 413 truncation failures.
- `browser_act` can now resolve semantic targets (`query`, `text_match`, `role`) internally, allowing multi-filter flows to run in one MCP call without separate find calls.
- Real Safari/Sahibinden validation completed a full Antalya -> Konyaaltı -> 2+1 -> Search -> navigation/stability flow in about 5 seconds with one parent MCP call. Tool count remains 69.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-07

- Added three MCP-only high-level browser tools: `browser_observe`, `browser_find`, and `browser_act`; existing browser tools remain unchanged.
- Added compact visible/actionable DOM observations with stable page-scoped element IDs, robust base64-encoded JSON transport, viewport coordinates and best-effort screen coordinates.
- Added optional optimized JPEG viewport/element visual observations instead of requiring full-window PNG/base64 screenshots.
- Added semantic/fuzzy target ranking across text, ARIA labels, placeholders, roles, names, and titles.
- Added one-call batch browser actions for click, type, select, key, scroll, and bounded wait conditions with compact post-action state.
- Added stale observation/element checks and page-context persistence without modifying page DOM attributes.
- MCP tool count is now 69. The existing 59-operation REST/OpenAPI surface remains unchanged; the new browser-agent layer is MCP-only.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-06

- Added `spawn_agents` for one-call parallel teams of up to 10 agents with persistent `team_id` state and enforced shared provider/model/reasoning/access configuration.
- Added `wait_agents` with bounded `all`, `any`, and `majority` completion modes to replace repeated status polling.
- Added progress/timing telemetry including phase, first-event latency, idle time, step/tool counts, and last tool.
- Added `idle_timeout_s` and automatic same-model retries; teams default to one retry with a short backoff, and never implicitly fall back to another model.
- Extended `list_agents` with team filtering and `agent_action` with team-level cancel/retry/despawn and cancellation cascade.
- Kept team wait output compact (2,000 characters per child handoff) to protect parent-chat context.
- MCP tool count is now 66. The existing 59-operation REST/OpenAPI surface remains unchanged; agent orchestration remains MCP-only.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-06

- Added five MCP-native agent delegation tools: `agent_catalog`, `spawn_agent`, `list_agents`, `get_agent`, and `agent_action`.
- Added non-blocking OpenCode and Codex execution with provider/model/reasoning selection, working-directory and access controls, bounded timeouts, and persistent on-disk agent state.
- Added concise parent-agent handoffs so delegated work can use its own context without flooding the calling ChatGPT conversation with intermediate logs or reasoning.
- Added resumable provider sessions (`message`), retries, cancellation, despawn, compact listings, and opt-in debug logs.
- Added macOS-aware OpenCode/Codex binary discovery, including Homebrew and the ChatGPT-bundled Codex binary.
- Verified real OpenCode and Codex delegation, session follow-up, retry, three parallel agents, timeout handling, cancellation cleanup, and provider failure handling.
- Added unit coverage for final-result extraction and provider command construction.
- MCP tool count is now 64. The existing 59-operation REST/OpenAPI surface remains unchanged for backwards compatibility; agent delegation is currently MCP-only.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-03

- Fixed `ask_choice` so three choices fit macOS's three-button native dialog limit; two-choice dialogs retain a visible Cancel button and four-or-more choices are rejected clearly.
- Added native `ask_choice` and `ask_confirmation` human-in-the-loop tools with bounded, fail-closed dialog handling.
- Prevented concurrent native prompts from stacking by returning `prompt_busy` immediately when a dialog is already active.
- Hardened timeout cleanup for AppleScript, browser, shell, and interactive subprocesses so descendants do not remain stuck in the background.
- Exposed all 59 MCP tools as one-to-one Custom GPT Action operations with matching `operationId` names.
- Added REST aliases for file, macOS, browser, search, `mac_observe`, and `mac_act` tools.
- Kept the legacy grouped REST routes available for backwards compatibility while hiding them from the published OpenAPI schema.
- Updated the bundled OpenAPI schema to version 1.1.1 and verified 59 valid operations.
- Documented the OpenAPI/Custom GPT refresh flow and added the new release notes.
